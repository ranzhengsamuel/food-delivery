Why I chose these 2 dataset?
Reason is that they have a large dataset with enough entry, and the items are comprehensive.

Preprocessing:
I saw missing data and did imputation, and found that the missing data does not affect the correlation. Before the Imputation, not much
correlation; after that, still not much.

IDA/EDA:
It was a bit shocking to me but after the IDA and EDA visualizations, I found out that all the other factors are not relavant to 
delivery time, the only thing that affects the delivery time is distance alone!

Streamlit:
I found that there are some codes in Python that streamlit does not recognize, that I need to get it changed before I can upload it.
