This Python script, `project.py`, is a simple web application built using the Streamlit library.

The application has the following features:
*   Displays a main title "我的第一个 Streamlit 应用" (My First Streamlit App).
*   Shows a header "这是一个二级标题" (This is a level 2 header).
*   Includes introductory text and formatted text using Markdown.
*   Displays a Pandas DataFrame with two columns.
*   Includes a button with the label "点我一下" (Click me). When the button is clicked, it displays the message "你点击了按钮！🎉" (You clicked the button! 🎉).

The script demonstrates basic Streamlit functionalities like displaying text, dataframes, and handling button clicks.
